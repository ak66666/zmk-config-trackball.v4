This project drives my Thumbs Up! Trackball v4 with nice!nano v2 (clone):
	https://github.com/ak66666/ThumbsUp-Trackball-v4

This is a trackball with PMW-3610 sensor driven by ZMK.

It is a slightly modified version of firmware for v3 (https://github.com/ak66666/ThumbsUp-Trackball-v4).
The only difference is the X and Y directions inverted:
In my infinite wisdom in v4 I rotated the sensor 180 degress from v3 position.
That produced unintended result of the directions being swapped.
